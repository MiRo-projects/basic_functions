# Basic Functions

Basic interface and functions for MiRo, to avoid re-inventing the wheel with every MiRo project

For development of standard operations such as movement, turning (using the kinematic chain), sensation, etc; new MiRo projects should be able to refer to a standard function here rather than having to re-code the same basic interactions anew each time.
